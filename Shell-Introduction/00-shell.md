In .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI), **Shell** is a feature designed to simplify the development of mobile applications by providing a consistent and streamlined way to manage the visual hierarchy and navigation of your app.

Here are some key aspects of .NET MAUI Shell:

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Shell allows you to define the visual structure of your app in a single place. This includes organizing pages into flyouts (side menus) and tabs, making it easier to manage complex navigation patterns.

2. **Navigation**: Shell provides a common navigation experience, including URI-based navigation. This means you can navigate to any page in your app using a URI, which simplifies deep linking and navigation logic.

3. **Integrated Search**: Shell includes a built-in search handler, making it easier to implement search functionality within your app.

4. **Flyouts and Tabs**: You can use flyouts for side menus and tabs for bottom navigation, depending on your app's requirements. This flexibility allows you to create intuitive and user-friendly navigation experiences.

5. **On-Demand Page Creation**: Pages in a Shell app are created on demand, which can improve performance and resource management¹.
